\section{Experience} 
  \cventry{Spring 2011 - February 2016}{Systems and architecture Engineer}{Parse.ly}{New York, NY}{}{
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Lead implementation of major backend systems for an
          engineering team that grew from 3 to 20 over the course of 4
          years. During this period, the company also grew to hundreds
          of customers, millions in revenue and massive data
          volumes. An overview of Parse.ly's core product is available
          on its website.
        \item After seed financing round in 2011, company hired other engineers to
          focus on areas like dashboard design and time series data. Took full
          ownership over backend systems and APIs while company pivoted into the
          content analytics market, where it ended up finding
          success. 
          \item  Built the second version of our API, which allowed
            customers to access analytics and recommendations data. It
            was adopted by 40\% of customers and by 2015 was serving 2
            billion calls per month. It serves 500
            requests per second and peaks up to
            2,000 requests per second. It powers
            popular websites like NewYorker.com and
            Arstechnica.com. Also wrote its public documentation. 
        % \item Designed and created an API for our publishers to access their
        %   analytics and recommendations data. The API powers multiple
        %   live dashboards and widgets. It serves on average 500 requests per second
        %   and peaks up to 1000-1500 requests per second. The
        %   documentation for the API is here:
        %   \url{https://www.parsely.com/docs/api/overview/endpoint.html}
        %   . Technologies used: Tornado, Redis, MongoDB, ElasticSearch,
        %   Cassandra.
          \item Assisted with migration from Rackspace Cloud to Amazon Web Services.
          \item Created the crawling system that processes over 100
            million URLs per month. Crawlers collect informative
            metadata from publishers' pages for 
          display on the Parse.ly's Dash analytics dashboard.  
        \item  Implemented several features in our real-time and batch
          analytics pipeline that processes hundreds of millions of events per
          day. The pipeline powers the Parse.ly's Dash analytics
          product.    
        \item Designed and implemented flexible auto-complete search for our
            dashboard analytics users. Users could complete either the beginning, middle or end of
            several words. Users were
            able to search millions of titles, authors and sections in
            a unified way  in less than 200ms. 
        \item Designed and developed named entity recognition system using Solr, 
          the Wikipedia index, Wikipedia traffic data, and NLTK. With
          this feature, users were able to see what topics were
          trending on the web based on the traffic they got from
          Wikipedia traffic.
        \item Automated  configuration and deployment for machines
          that were used to do API, crawling or search work using Chef
          and Vagrant.
          \item During period of high growth, performed several
            technology evaluations as company refreshed its technology
            stack for scale. Company raised series A financing in 2013
            and grew to a total headcount of over 40, while landing
            new customers that included the highest-traffic websites
            on the Internet, such as Reuters, The Huffington Post,
            Business Insider, and WIRED. Evaluated distributed systems
            like Elasticsearch and Cassandra, which were eventually
            adopted to replace MongoDB and Solr. 
      \end{itemize}
  }
  \cventry{Summer 2009 - Sprint 2011}{Software Engineer \& Employee \#1}{Parse.ly}{New York, NY}{}{
    \begin{itemize}
      \item First engineering hire at an early-stage startup that was
        part of Dreamit Ventures 2009, a YCombinator-like startup
        accelerator program in Philadelphia, PA. 
      \item Wrote and launched the back-end to the Parse.ly Reader[4],
        a news article reader (similar concept to Flipboard, but
        before Flipboard's launch) that displayed articles from the
        web based on a user interests. Used Django and Solr. Worked
        directly with CTO. 
      \item Rewrote backend to support a content recommendation API
          for publishers, as company moved into the enterprise API
          space serving content publishers. These systems helped the
          company land its first customers. Worked as sole full-time
          engineer through Parse.ly's bootstrapping period. 
        \item  Company raised a seed financing round in 2011 and
          changed its focus, while re-using technology developed
          during this founding period.  
    \end{itemize}
  }

  \cventry{Winter 2007 - Spring 2008}{Senior Python
    contractor}{Wordstream}{Boston, MA}{}{
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Designed and implemented a keyword-matching algorithm
        that accepts documents as its input and produces a list of
        suggested hyperlinks to be added by a user. The suggested
        keywords are based on the user's profile data. 
    \end{itemize}
  }
  \cventry{2007 - 2008}{Software Engineer}{Intelligent Information Systems}{Durham, NC}{}{
    \begin{itemize}
      % \item Helped design and implement a web application that allows
      %   some North Carolina counties to handle and process appeals
      %   related to taxes on property made by residents of these
      %   counties using C\#, ASP.NET, MS SQL and Javascript 
      \item Designed and implemented a website so clients could
        access and browse property inspection information 
      \item Implemented and improved a procedure to port and test
        programs written in VB6 to VB.NET. Converted over 100 programs
        written in VB6 code to VB.NET using a combination of the MS
        conversion tool and Python. 
    \end{itemize}
